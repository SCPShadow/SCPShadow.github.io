            <p>
                <td>1. The breed name Ragdoll was given because of the cat having a tendency to go limp when lifted,
                    just like a rag
                    doll. But as relaxed as these cats may be when being handled.</td>
                <td>2. When Ragdolls are born, they are pure white and develop their coat colour and pattern over the
                    first 2 weeks
                    of their life.</td>
                <td>3. Their fur colour is only activated in parts of the body that have the coolest temperature.</td>
                <td>4. Ragdolls have tufts of hair between their toes, like other long hair cats, this is to protect
                    them from
                    direct contact with wet and icy ground.</td>
                <td>5. Just like dogs, a Ragdoll will often greet you when you come home!</td>
