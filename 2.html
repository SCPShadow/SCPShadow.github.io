                <td>1. Great Danes used to be called the German Boarhound in the 18th century and were later marketed as
                    the German
                    Dogge or German Mastiff. Following increased tensions between Germany and other countries, the true
                    place of the
                    breed's origin was removed from the dog's name, and the Great Dane was created.</td>
                <td>2. Despite its intimidating size, the Great Dane is extraordinarily gentle and gets along well with
                    children.
                    They are even known to befriend cats.</td>
                <td>3. In the United States they are classified as a large dog breed, but in the U.K. they are
                    classified in the
                    Giant class of dogs.</td>
                <td>4. The world record holder in the tallest dog category is a 42 inch tall Great Dane (Giant George).
                    Although,
                    the Great Danes are not the tallest breed, the Irish wolfhound tends to be taller but has a lighter
                    weight than
                    Great Danes.</td>
                <td>5. The Great Danes grow incredibly fast. Within a span of just one year, they go from just a handful
                    of fluffy
                    puppy to being able to stand up on their hind legs and look six foot tall dog.</td>
