            <td>1. Great Danes used to be called the German Boarhound in the 18th century and were later marketed as the
                German Dogge or German Mastiff. Following increased tensions between Germany and other countries, the
                true place of the breed's origin was removed from the dog's name, and the Great Dane was created.</td>
            <td>2. Despite its intimidating size, the Great Dane is extraordinarily gentle and gets along well with
                children. They are even known to befriend cats.</td>
            <td>3. In the United States they are classified as a large dog breed, but in the U.K. they are classified in
                the Giant class of dogs.</td>
            <td>4. The world record holder in the tallest dog category is a 42 inch tall Great Dane (Giant George).
